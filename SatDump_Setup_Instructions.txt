### Setting Up and Running SatDump with USB Access in WSL

1. **Open Ubuntu (WSL) as Administrator:**
   - Right-click on the Ubuntu icon in your Start menu and select "Run as administrator."

2. **Install Necessary Packages:**
   - Update package lists:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install required packages if not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install usbip
     ```

3. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-click, and select "Run as administrator."

4. **Start USBIP Daemon:**
   - In PowerShell, run the following command to start the USBIP daemon:
     ```powershell
     usbipd wsl start
     ```

5. **List Available USB Devices:**
   - Check for your USB device using the command:
     ```powershell
     usbipd list
     ```

6. **Attach USB Device to WSL:**
   - Use the following command to attach the USB device (replace `4-1` with your actual bus ID if different):
     ```powershell
     usbipd attach --busid 4-1 --wsl
     ```

7. **Open Ubuntu (WSL) Again:**
   - If you closed it, open Ubuntu again (no need to run as admin this time).

8. **Verify USB Device Connection:**
   - In Ubuntu, check if the USB device is connected:
     ```bash
     lsusb
     ```

9. **Navigate to SatDump Build Directory:**
   - Change to the directory where SatDump is built:
     ```bash
     cd ~/SatDump/build
     ```

10. **Run SatDump UI:**
    - Start the SatDump user interface:
      ```bash
      ./satdump-ui
      ```

### Notes:
- If the `xclock` command fails, ensure your X server is running (like VcXsrv) and set the DISPLAY variable correctly.
- If you want to automate the USB attachment, consider creating a batch script to run on startup as mentioned earlier.
